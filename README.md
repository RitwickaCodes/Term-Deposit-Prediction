# Term Deposit Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using various machine learning techniques.
## Project Structure

- **Term Deposit Prediction.ipynb**: A detailed Jupyter notebook that walks through the data analysis process, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Problem Statement.pdf**: The document outlining the project's goals and the problem to be solved.
- **solution_checker.xlsx**: A tool for validating the accuracy of the predictions.
- **submission1.csv**: The file containing the final predictions on the test dataset.
- **test1.csv**: The dataset used to test the model.
- **train1.csv**: The dataset used to train the model.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Proficient in managing categorical variables, handling missing data, and scaling features for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Adept at uncovering patterns and correlations within the data to inform model decisions.
- **Modeling**: Experienced in implementing and tuning classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilized metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to rigorously assess model performance.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Term-Deposit-Prediction.git
   ```
2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn

   You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**
   Open `Term Deposit Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to see the analysis and model in action.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
-Designing and implementing machine learning pipelines for binary classification.
-Optimizing models to balance precision and recall for better decision-making.
-Using advanced data visualization techniques to communicate findings.
